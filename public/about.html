<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I’m a web developer with a strong background in systems engineering and technology integration. 
  I currently work at Marquis Systems Inc., where I’ve spent the past five years testing and integrating cameras, 
  security systems, and other smart technologies. My work involves blending technical expertise with 
  creativity—ensuring that every system not only performs reliably but also delivers a seamless experience 
  for end users.
</p>

<p>Before joining Marquis, I had the opportunity to work with Cal-Agrex Inc and a global trading company 
  that exported nuts across Asia and Europe. Those experiences helped me develop a deep appreciation for both 
  fast-paced innovation and international collaboration, shaping how I approach problem-solving and teamwork today.
</p>

<p>Beyond work, I have a wonderful family who keeps my life exciting and full of laughter. I’m passionate about 
  sports, especially tennis and mountain biking, and I   approach life with a positive, grateful outlook. I 
  believe every day is a gift, and I never miss a chance to thank the Lord for the blessings I receive. 
  There’s truly never a dull moment when I’m around family and friends.</p>
